        <h3>intro</h3>
        <p>
            autovivarium site is a project to automate the needs and maintenance of a population of 
            <i>Dionaea muscipula</i> (and possibly other latin names too).
        </p>

        <h3>description</h3>

        <p> 
            the autovivarium currently consists of a single-board computer connected to a humidity/temperature sensor 
            that reads the vivarium temperature and humidity every 5 minutes. A webcam is also connected and programmed
            to take a shot at the minute 30 of every hour. All the data is then sent to a server that stores 
            the information in a database.
        </p>
        <p>there's also a computer fan connected to a potentiometer to manually adjust the air velocity of the vivarium.</p>

        <h3>methods and materials</h3>

        <p>
            the autovivarium site is made of three main parts:
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>single-board computer = a raspberry pi</li>
                <li>server = a nodejs application using express middleware</li>
                <li>client = this .html file, a .js file and a .css file</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>
            the raspberry pi has a raspbian linux distribution with a python script that uses the fourth GPIO pin on the raspberry 
            to read data from the dht11 sensor and send it to the nodejs application. The nodejs server stores the data as .json files in a 
            folder. Those .json files are later requested by the client application and displayed in the chart below. The raspberry pi
            is set to run the python script every 5 minutes thanks to a cronjob.

        <p>
            probably it can be done for less and with infinite hardware/software/medium configurations but this is 
            the way that seemed more convenient for me. Also prices and licenses were checked in 2019. If 
            some information is outdated, please <a href="#conclusions">submit a ticket</a>.
